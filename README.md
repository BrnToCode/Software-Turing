I developed a Python application using Selenium and JSON to automate WhatsApp operations. The application automates the extraction of contacts based on specified keywords, enhancing efficiency by reducing manual effort. It leverages Selenium to interact with the WhatsApp web interface, searches for relevant keywords, extracts the corresponding contacts, and stores them in a structured JSON format. Additionally, I implemented a feature to prevent duplicate contacts from being saved, ensuring data integrity.
